The course then moves into **React.js**, the industry’s leading frontend library used by companies like Meta, Netflix, Uber, and Airbnb. Students learn how to build reusable components, manage application state, use hooks, integrate APIs, manage routing, and optimize performance. They also develop complete projects such as dashboards, e-commerce frontends, and portfolio websites using React.js combined with Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap.

Throughout the 8-month learning journey, students work on multiple projects, including landing pages, multi-page websites, product UI pages, dashboards, React applications, and dynamic forms. These projects help build strong portfolios required for internships, placements, and freelance opportunities. The focus remains on **industry-level coding standards**, clean code practices, responsive UI design, accessibility standards, and real-world workflow experience.
